# checkpoint-Express
The purpose of this checkpoint is to test routing

Note :
Create a web application containing 3 pages :


home.html
ourservices.html
contact.html


Each page contains a navbar and some contents. Feel free to put any information you want

The web application is open between 8h and 17h. If a user accesses to the web app before 8h or after 17h, a message is displayed "Our office is not open now"

Then, use express to handle each route path
